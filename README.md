# IPL-Data-Analysis
## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze IPL data to extract valuable insights about team strategies, player performances, and game trends. Through data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis, we explore various aspects of IPL matches to identify significant patterns and correlations.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/04Sanjanaa/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/deliveries%201.xlsx">Deliveries dataset </a>
- <a href="https://github.com/04Sanjanaa/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/matches.xls">Matches dataset </a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- How many total matches have been played in the IPL?
- How many total deliveries have been bowled in IPL history?
- How many unique teams have participated in the IPL?
- How many IPL seasons are covered in the dataset?
- Which team has played the most matches?
- Which team has won the most matches?
- Who is the highest run-scorer in IPL history?
- Who has taken the most wickets in IPL history?

- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/04Sanjanaa/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/dashboard.pdf">View Dashboard </a>

## Process

- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

## Key Features

## Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Loading and merging match and delivery datasets.
- Handling missing values and removing inconsistencies.
- Data type conversion and feature extraction.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generating summary statistics for teams, players, and venues.
- Visualizing run rates, strike rates, and economy rates.
- Analyzing win percentages, toss decisions, and match outcomes.
- Examining batting and bowling performances over different seasons.

## Performance Metrics
- Batsmen Analysis: Runs, strike rate, consistency, and boundary percentages.
- Bowler Analysis: Wickets taken, economy rate, and bowling efficiency.
- Team Performance: Winning trends across seasons, head-to-head records, and dominance at specific venues.

## Match Insights & Trends
- Impact of toss decisions on match outcomes.
- Role of home advantage in winning percentages.
- Influence of pitch conditions and venues on scoring patterns.
- Identifying top-performing players and teams across IPL seasons.

## Technologies Used
- Python 
- Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning models for predictions.
